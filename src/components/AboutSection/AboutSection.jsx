        Known internally as the Studio team, our specialty was bespoke
        design for the <span className="ff-gillroy-b blk-color">worldâ€™s biggest creators </span>
        and gaming brands. What began as a few
        one-off projects for streamers evolved into a separate business unit in need of its own,
        unique identity.

          In <span className="ff-gillroy-b blk-color">2018 </span>
          the vision for a new brand began. It would be an agency focused exclusively on
          custom design for VIP influencers and brands. The name, <span className="ff-gillroy-b blk-color">Visuals Branding </span>
          , harkens to fresh beginnings and innovation. Staffed with the same award-nominated creatives,
          our team has more talent and resources than ever. The mission remains the same: to
          connect fans and creators like never before.
